Max LOVED the first class yesterday. He was so excited about it! -Marisa

Aurora May *LOVES* the class. I am a little late in logging into Tinkercad, but excited to find her name plate there. And now I know she can play further and do other projects there. We'll check it out more later this week! Thank YOU. -Jenny
