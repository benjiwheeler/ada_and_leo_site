Max LOVED the first class yesterday. He was so excited about it! -Marisa

Aurora May *LOVES* the class. I am a little late in logging into Tinkercad, but excited to find her name plate there. And now I know she can play further and do other projects there. We'll check it out more later this week! Thank YOU. -Jenny

Rishi is really enjoying his tech classes. He asked us why normal school was not as much fun...
-Vin Sharma

Would totally do it again! - Elizabeth Grosser

My daughter has taken this class twice now, last fall and this past winter. I thought I would have trouble getting her up on Saturday mornings, but I never did. She enjoyed Ben's class so very much and couldn't stop talking about all the things she leaned once class was over." -Marsha-Stephanie Blake
