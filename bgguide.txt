10,/boardgame/22303/celebrities,Celebrities,(You don't need to buy anything to play this, just read the rules.)<br /><br />Simply the greatest party game ever. I absolutely guarantee hysterical laughter and intense competition.
10,/boardgame/13/catan,Catan,Such elegant design! So few choices, but ones that matter! Such good use of randomness! Such simple compensation for being behind! Such pressure and reason to negotiate! So many ways to win! Just a perfect game, satisfying nearly every time I've ever played. It's true that if you aren't good at it, you won't win... that's not the same as &ldquo;he player behind can't catch up&rdquo;.<br /><br />And nearly immune to analysis paralysis, because so few options are open each turn. It can get a bit stuck in complex negotiation proposals.
10,/boardgame/1198/set,SET,30 plays: You can start a game in seconds, and everyone in earshot will come over and want to play and be instantly captivated. It's not always obvious who will be good, and almost anyone can win some sets against more talented players. 
9,/boardgame/54043/jaipur,Jaipur,25 plays in: Has a calming flow to it, a rhythm and balance that make winning and losing not seem like the point. Setup is a pain in the ass, though, with sorting all the metal coin tokens by value, though once you get familiar with them, you don't really need to do more than sort by color. And &ldquo;let's see who had the higher score&rdquo; is always a weak way to end a game. Doesn't jump off the shelf like, say, Monopoly Deal, but we're always glad we played it.<br /><br />The strategy is truly elegant and unique here -- the role of the camels is simple yet deepens the game immensely. And there is a direct back-and-forth push and pull of the players' impact on each other, which makes gameplay intimate and satisfying.<br /><br />Gets asked for very often; always seems like fun and not homework, and yet skilled players definitely do better. Just a perfect gem of a game.
9,/boardgame/2397/backgammon,Backgammon,A perfect synthesis of luck and strategy. Endlessly surprising, fascinating and deep. You're not even close to learning it until you pull off your first &ldquo;back game&rdquo;. <br /><br />Elegant and simple setup and rules, and huge number of players out there ready to play. <br /><br />The perfect game to play in a cafe with tea and a hookah...<br /><br />Only drawback is some memorization needed to compete at a very high level.
8,/boardgame/98778/hanabi,Hanabi,Elegant in its simplicity and depth. One of the greatest games for a group who want to enjoy themselves. Intense, but not frustrating because of cooperative nature. Tends towards some slow analysis paralysis, but again that's mitigated by cooperation... You don't feel that you must take as long as the previous player to keep up. Definitely requires a good level of skill and abstract thinking. Expands and contracts easily from 2-8 players. Addictive!
8,/boardgame/9209/ticket-ride,Ticket to Ride,10 plays: a light game, accessible to kids, able to be cutthroat and intense with skilled players. What's great is that it's quick to learn set up, and the turn to turn play is satisfying and flows nicely; there is next to analysis paralysis. My complaint is that the whole thing doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts. The many colors have no ultimate meaning; they are interchangeable abstractions that have no consistent role on the board. The destinations are arbitrary. Scoring seems almost like an afterthought. But it's always ready to take off the shelf and play, and one of the most widely flexible games for various ages and skill levels.
8,/boardgame/8203/hey-s-my-fish,Hey That's My Fish!,Intriguing combination of simplicity and depth. Sometimes I think this should be a game played as often in 2nd grade as Checkers and Chess. In a way, it's a perfect game to exercise chess-like strategy and tactics, with less depth and complexity than chess. <br /><br />Takes a while to set up and play, and the theme isn't as big a draw with kids as I'd think. <br /><br />Gets asked for moderately often.
8,/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo,King of Tokyo,Light and quick but very compelling. Kids love it, as young as 5, and can play it, but it has enough tricky decisions to sustain attention from more sophisticated gamers. Takes absolutely no setup and really doesn't even require much explanation to new players. Fun with any number of players above one.
8,/boardgame/6891/24-game,24 Game,Brilliant game of basic math numeracy, enjoyable, challenging and educational to anyone older than maybe 6. Not really a game, so much as a series of surprisingly enjoyable math puzzles. 
8,/boardgame/65244/forbidden-island,Forbidden Island,30 plays: Great little cooperative game, perfectly tuned for narrow losses and victories, which makes for a great feeling. Easy to take off the shelf, easy to set up, and great to look at. There's a real feeling of drama as the island disappears!<br /><br />Always fun, but doesn't have that deeper level of satisfaction that Settlers does for me. My daughter enjoyed it at 5, but didn't really understand how to pick her moves until 10 plays in. Definitely suffers from Alpha Player syndrome, where clever players have to resist bossing everyone else around.<br /><br />Wonderful visual design, though I wish at times that the different tiles actually did different things to reflect their mysterious names and artwork!<br /><br />Probably the game we play most often at the moment of this writing! And a perfect gateway game for non-gamers.
8,/boardgame/6351/gulo-gulo,Gulo Gulo,15 plays: Central mechanic is a bowl of wooden eggs, with a chopstick sticking upwards in them that wants to fall over. Can you remove a blue, green, red or yellow egg so that the stick doesn't fall?<br /><br />Egg stealing part of game is wonderful. But traversing board feels a little tacked on. One of my 4 year old's favorites, and a game I enjoy and that is legitimately challenging to me, with my older, larger, clumsier fingers.<br /><br />Gets asked for incredibly often -- just has a fun, compelling theme that feels mischievous.
8,/boardgame/5782/coloretto,Coloretto,3 plays; very catchy, elegant and satisfying! light but with a nice touch of tactics and subverson of your opponents. Instructions are incredibly bad!
8,/boardgame/2596/villa-paletti,Villa Paletti,10 plays: Maybe my favorite game to play with my 4 year old daughter. Great physical design. Not really much of a game, more like coop tower building. Provokes lots of thought about weight and balance. Not played more than one or twice at a time, and seldom requested by my daughter, but always enjoyed by both of us when we do. 
8,/boardgame/129622/love-letter,Love Letter,20 plays: A real gem of a light, casual game. Very fast to learn. Only a tiny bit of strategy involved, and playable with no strategy at all, so it scales to all ages; theme is delightful. I do wish cards had been added which included real love letters, just to hold in your hand next to your one card to clarify that that card indicates who currently holds your love letter, rather than who &ldquo;you&rdquo; are. It does feel at times like several turns will go by without requiring very interesting decisions. And advanced gamers may find it basically a &ldquo;solved&rdquo; game like tic-tac-toe. But the simplicity, quickness of play and delightful theme make it a perfect casual game for all ages.
7,/boardgame/68448/7-wonders,7 Wonders,Beautiful visual design and concept. It feels great to build up your city. <br /><br />Similar to Dominion in the central mechanic of &ldquo;play cards that use my resources to either build more resource capacity, or cash in on my existing resource capacity&rdquo;. But unlike Dominion, the theme and card names make coherent sense, and there's some satisfaction in playing an impressive card with a cool design.<br /><br />Excellent core game mechanic where everyone plays simultaneously. There is no negotiation, and all of this makes the game go quickly but always play a bit differently. <br /><br />I wish the player interaction were a greater part of the game, though; you don't have the same kind of &ldquo;DDAAAAMMMNNN YYYOOOUUUU&rdquo; moment you can have in Catan when someone blocks your growth. Decisions seem relatively easy each turn.<br /><br />Winning depends on who has accumulated points in half a dozen different ways by the end, which is the way some other games, like Smallworld, work too. This preserves the sense that anyone might win, but it's anticlimactic and it means strategic decisions never feel high stakes.<br /><br />So it's a great looking, accessible family game, if a little intimidating at first with its seeming complexity; it's really a very simple game. Fun and light, and a real challenge to beat a clever player.<br /><br />Of course, the real test is how often my kids ask to play it, which is often!
7,/boardgame/63268/spot-it,Spot it!,15 plays: Incredibly simple, yet challenging. Can be played by any number and any age, even younger than SET. Like SET, everyone can be the winner sometimes, though it doesn't have the replay addiction factor of SET. This is a must-get for kids. 
7,/boardgame/50/lost-cities,Lost Cities,10 plays: Nice, light feeling but sorta deep variation on the Fantan type of paying cards game. Simple and well made components. But in my mind, not the perfect filler that others feel it is. I think the theme and the points based system keep it from being more compelling.
7,/boardgame/40692/small-world,Small World,5 plays: I love playing this game, but it's a bit tough to get other people into it. The fantasy theme turns off some players, and it takes a few plays to feel like everything isn't arbitrary. Also, the endgame is weak because it's so often obvious who has won, and there's little anyone can do about that. But I've mostly played with 2 people. <br /><br />Also, the scoring in general make you slow down to count and collect point tokens. It's just clunky. <br /><br />That said, I adore the game design from top to bottom, and gameplay is simple and elegant, with plenty of room for strategy but not much analysis paralysis. And it's not at all fiddly, which I care a lot about. 
7,/boardgame/327/loopin-louie,Loopin' Louie,40 plays: Wonderful fun, gets played more than any other game at our house by children under 5, by far. but has the weakness that holding down the levers protects your chickens almost all the time. It's not as good a strategy as an adult can devise, but it's good enough that it blocks kids from willingness to experiment. 
7,/boardgame/2651/power-grid,Power Grid,5 plays in: I really enjoy playing this game. But other people I play games with don't love it like I do. the resource supply feels very fiddly to me -- I hate looking up numbers in a chart, that feels so clunky and inelegant, and takes focus from the gameplay. Analysis paralysis in the endgame. The player order thing feels so randomly imposed. Love the auction mechanic, including ability to inflate the price of a plant and dump it on someone else. Don't love the map stuff -- it feels so arbitrary where you begin, since you'd probably do better if you paralyzed yourself and did tons of analysis...
7,/boardgame/17329/animal-upon-animal,Animal Upon Animal,Components are wonderful, and stacking is joyous and always in new ways. Requires focus and hand-eye coordination, which are developed in a fun way.<br /><br />However, gameplay rules seem tacked on, and it feels like a slightly unfinished game. 
7,/boardgame/171/chess,Chess,Obviously, Chess's nearly endless depth is its most powerful feature, and it's hard to balance that with an evaluation of its appeal for casual players.<br /><br />With that said, I think one of the game's great aspects of accessibility to a casual player is that while there are many possible moves at any one time, there are often only a handful that aren't obviously mistakes, which lightens the experience and lessons analysis paralysis. <br /><br />Still, requiring a timer for games to not feel agonizing and sluggish reflects a basic flaw in the game. (Compare to Poker or Backgammon, for example, which are turn-based and have many possibilities but don't require timers.)
7,/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue,Flash Point: Fire Rescue,20 plays: a hit with everyone I introduce it to. very compelling and involving theme. A bit fiddly for my taste--too many little chits, too much reading the rules for the full version. But even the simplified family version is very involving, and everyone makes explosion sounds and prays to make it out with a victim before the building collapses. Fewer interesting questions of strategy than I would like; I'm seldom unsure of what to do on my turn. Given the fiddliness of the full rules, I wish the game decisions were more complex. But it's hard to overemphasize what a  massive hit this is with kids. I find myself really wanting to play more, and my 5 year old worships it.
6,/boardgame/822/carcassonne,Carcassonne,Only played a few times. I can definitely see the appeal: clear, elegant, in some ways free-flowing, in other ways back-stabbing... only mechanic I didn't love was the scoring tabulation, and relying on scoring for victory. Wish there was a bit more direct player interaction surrounding victory.
6,/boardgame/432/6-nimmt,6 nimmt!,Version I have is &ldquo;Tag 6&rdquo;, aka &ldquo; 6 Nimmt&rdquo;. I really like it, but I find that it's very hard for me to get friends and family to play abstract card games that don't use regular paying cards. Too bad, I think this game has a may combination of trick taking strategy and opportunity cost considerations a la Lost Cities.
6,/boardgame/40398/monopoly-deal-card-game,Monopoly Deal Card Game,10 plays: Surprisingly compelling. Feels arbitrary due to luck of the draw, but there's enough room for strategy and game theory that it stays satisfying.
6,/boardgame/39856/dixit,Dixit,20 plays: Prompts creativity in a beautiful way. Official game rules and tokens are poorly designed, and instead of paying by the rules, my daughters and I just make up stories using the cards. But that way of playing is still cool.<br /><br />What doesn't work well is that the cards are so specific. You can't really just say &ldquo;Revenge is sweet, said the woman as she walked away from the cliff!&rdquo;... because that denies that the cliff is made up of negative space or her hair or whatever. I wish the illustrations were more universal and less metaphysically clever --it's hard to craft a story that isn't just literally tied to what you see. 
6,/boardgame/3955/bang,BANG!,Everyone likes playing, and the core mystery about identities is fun, but it can feel pretty weak on strategy and decision making. The shooting range and dynamite game mechanics feel tacked on -- the whole game just doesn't really come together. Still, a fun game to break out with a group.
6,/boardgame/20100/wits-wagers,Wits & Wagers,5 plays: A clever solution to the fundamental problems of trivia games: 1) people are on wildly different playing fields, and 2) questions are only good if they fall in that narrow space between the obvious and the impossibly obscure.<br /><br />Instead, the focus is on the debate about answers, in almost a cooperative vein.<br /><br />This game is also a surprisingly good way to develop numeracy in children.<br /><br />6 year old asks for it often. Choosing relevant questions for kids takes some parental editing.
6,/boardgame/188/go,Go,10 plays: Obviously, Go has phenomenal depth and really quite simple rules that elegantly make for naturally resulting complexity. I don't yet find in it the same sense of risk and daring that I find in Backgammon, but I'm intrigued to appreciate it more as I play more games.
6,/boardgame/169147/letter-tycoon,Letter Tycoon,One play: The components are incredibly well designed and well made--superbly so. The core mechanics--forming words from your gardens of letters, and investing in letters that you earn income on--are compelling. But it's very hard to form words by rearranging the cards you're holding in your hand, as opposed to a stand as in Scrabble. There's not much player interaction, since royalties are paid by the bank and not by players themselves. The win conditions seem a bit arbitrary. It's a decent game, but doesn't make people eager to play again after finishing.
6,/boardgame/148228/splendor,Splendor,3 plays: Elegant, but a little dry compared to the clearer theme of 7 Wonders or the deck-building, play-chaining satisfaction of Dominion. Compared to those, it's almost like solitaire. Frustratingly little player interaction. Each turn presents a small, satisfying decision, though a close game presents analysis paralysis because there's so much useful information to consider. Doesn't seem like the gold coin feature was quite designed right -- it becomes much harder to be clear on which cards you can afford to buy, and at what cost.
6,/boardgame/145639/coconuts,Coconuts,Kids love it, and it does require quite a bit of thought and care to do well, so it's surprisingly educational. Don't think the cards and overall game design are great, but the components are very well made.<br /><br />Somehow, though we all like it, we don't pull it down and play it often. It feels somehow like a bit of a chore.
6,/boardgame/1406/monopoly,Monopoly,20 plays: I like it much more than most. It's all about negotiating complex deals (against the official rules, but so what), since monopolies are so crucial. In that sense, it's almost like Diplomacy in its requirement of dealmaking.
6,/boardgame/140/pit,Pit,2 plays: Extremely simple and shallow, but universally accessible and addictive. Somehow gets everyone playing and crowding around, and can't sit within my extended family's sight without getting played!
6,/boardgame/1197/blink,Blink,Great, simple game. A bit addictive, but not quite as compelling as either SET or the traditional card game Spit, the two of which this game is something of a blend.
6,/boardgame/11/bohnanza,Bohnanza,Compelling theme, and a game that flows pleasantly. But quite a lot of rules that are tough to keep straight, especially in the 2-player version. There are still spectra that I'm confused about; the rules couldn't be more verbose and confusing. Still, one that my 5 year old asks for.
5,/boardgame/760/battle-line,Battle Line,A game that seems on paper like it should be delightful and intriguing but which feels in practice bogged down with too many possibilities and too much information. Because you have so much information, it can be fruitful, though unpleasant, to take an immense time comparing all of the possibilities. And though the rules themselves are pretty simple, it is complicated to apply the question of whether or not a given battle is winnable; that may well change after a card is played somewhere else, so really you have to be reevaluating many battles after each card is played. The tension and intriguing possibilities don't mount, but merely peter off. Just feels like it doesn't begin to live up to its promise.
5,/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy,Race for the Galaxy,So far, it's intriguing, but it's a tremendous amount of constant work to keep track of the sum effect of all your cards, and there are a large number of possible choices for most decisions, which can make it seem to take forever.<br /><br />Given the relative complexity of the rules, the cards and symbols are poorly designed.
5,/boardgame/132322/snug-bug-rug,Snug as a Bug in a Rug,5 plays: A simple and straightforward game that develops visual and symbolic recognition for kids. Not very compelling beyond that; has some interesting complexity, but that complexity is very hard to communicate to kids. Parents end up doing a lot of coaching.
5,/boardgame/1260/rook,Rook,A game this similar to standard playing card games needs a strong reason to exist as a custom set of cards that must be purchased. Way better to just play or develop a trick taking game like spades, hearts, or pitch.
4,/boardgame/93688/sneaky-snacky-squirrel-game,The Sneaky Snacky Squirrel Game,10 plays: Incredibly beautifully designed, and good at teaching hand-eye coordination. But the game rules and mechanics that are tacked on are essentially the worst they could possibly be. For a game for small children, the spinner can be remarkably devastating. Does not sustain attention.
4,/boardgame/5048/candy-land,Candy Land,The standard rules are a snoozefest. But it's easy to try out other rules, eg holding hands of possibilities and playing one you choose. 
4,/boardgame/38453/space-alert,Space Alert,2 plays: So much fiddling with this or that aspect, instead of feeling immersed in the game's world and pressure. Too damn many parts and numbers.
4,/boardgame/3837/rat-tat-cat,Rat-a-Tat Cat,2 plays: Disappointing. The art and game design seem at first well done, but I get the sense gameplay doesn't actually involve many of the most attractive ideas and power plays. The central mechanism is just deeply flawed and the game solidly fails to be what it is trying to be. Still, does introduce the concept of expected value well.
4,/boardgame/2223/uno,UNO,20 plays: Unwieldy deck of cards, lack of strategy in gameplay... what a waste of a crossover game.
4,/boardgame/11585/sum-swamp,Sum Swamp,1 play: The basic mechanic of using arithmetic to determine the number of spaces to move is a well-designed mechanic. If only the board weren't so boring and arbitrary!
3,/boardgame/31016/we-didnt-playtest-all,We Didn't Playtest This At All,2 plays: Wanted this game to be so stupid it was fun. Nope, just stupid. No one in my group enjoyed it, and no one wants to ever play it again.
